# ChemDraw-Style-Molecule-Whiteboard
Full Stack development of a an interactive molecular whiteboard allowing users to draw organic molecules, connect elements with different bonds, and automatically generate molecular data and stereochemical information
Project Description: My project is an interactive organic molecule builder that allows users to create organic molecules by connecting carbon atoms and other elements using single, double, and triple bonds. Users can construct unique molecular structures, which the program will analyze to identify key features, such as the longest carbon chain, the largest branch chain, and the presence of double or triple bonds. Based on this analysis, the program will generate the molecule's SMILES notation. Then using the SMILE notation, various facts about the molecule can be generated using either the PubChem API or the module RDKit. 

Instructions for running the program: The program is contained in a single filed named 'TP'. To set up the RDKit module, type into the command prompt 'pip install rdkit'. (CMU Graphics is also needed)

No shortcut commands exist.
